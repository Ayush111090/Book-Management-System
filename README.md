The system will demonstrate essential SQL concepts, including Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Query Language (DQL), Data Control Language (DCL), Transaction Control Language (TCL), aggregate functions, joins, subqueries, views, stored procedures, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
